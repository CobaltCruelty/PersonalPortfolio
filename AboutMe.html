        <h2>I am Ar John. I am a game developer and a 3D artist.</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Ar John, but you can call me Arj for short. Game development and 3D art have always been a passion of mine, which inspires me to work on projects related to video games or 3D art.</p>
        <p> I am a graduate of FEU Institute of technology with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology with specialization in Animation and Game Development. For game development, I can use engines such as Unity and Roblox Studio alongside their respective scripting languages, such as C# and Lua U. I can also use Blender or Maya for 3D modeling things such as objects or characters and be able to texture them inside Blender.</p>
